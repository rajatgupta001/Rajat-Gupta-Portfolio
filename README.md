# My Portfolio

Hi! I am Rajat. I have worked with Karnataka Bank as an officer for 2.5 years and during my stint there I got to know more about myself and found that I love solving complex problems and programming is the arena where I can do this tangibly and gain satisfaction. Now, I am doing what I love fulltime and this is my portfolio in the making.

Welcome to my portfolio. 

It's coming up today when I learn HTML and CSS with Tanay Pratap on youtube.

For now, I know:

1. javascript
1. Nodejs
1. repl.it
1. Netlify
